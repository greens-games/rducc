## Purpose
- Inital intention is to learn graphics programming by building a basic immediate mode graphics renderer library
- Extend to be a GUI library intended to be used for other desktop applications


## Current tasks
- Physics
    - Check collision accounting for rotation
- Game
    - Check bullet and other collisions without having to loop through all entities many times
    - Enemies
    - Weapons

## Renderer TODOs
- Draw text (start with bitmap fonts)
- Draw sprite/texture
- Draw circle
- Get hot reloading working
    - Shaders
    - Textures
    - Gameplay code

## Physics TODOs
- Check rect collisions accounting for rotation

## Plans
- Possibly use the renderer to build a game
