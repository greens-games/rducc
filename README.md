## Purpose
- Inital intention is to learn graphics programming by building a basic immediate mode graphics renderer library
- Extend to be a GUI library intended to be used for other desktop applications


## Current tasks
- Renderer
    - Draw circle
- Physics
    - Circle collisions
        - Circle - Circle
        - Circle - Rect
    - Polygon collisions
- Game
    - Enemies
    - Weapons

## Renderer TODOs
- Draw Polygons
- Draw text (start with bitmap fonts)
- Draw sprite/texture
- Draw circle
- Get hot reloading working
    - Shaders
    - Textures
    - Gameplay code

## Physics
- Collision module is just for detecting if 2 objects are colliding
- We want a module to apply different formulas depending on if 2 objects colliding and some properties about them

## Plans
- Possibly use the renderer to build a game
